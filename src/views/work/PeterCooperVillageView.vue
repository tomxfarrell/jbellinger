        <p>When Tishman Speyer acquired Peter Cooper Village/Stuyvesant Town, they set out to completely reimagine the brand to align with their vision for the property. Known for its spacious apartments and vibrant, family-friendly lifestyle, Peter Cooper Village offered a unique blend of urban living and community charm. To highlight these qualities, I designed and helped direct an above shot/aerial-style photoshoot that beautifully captured the propertyâ€™s expansive apartments, lush green parks, and tranquil, park-like setting nestled within the city. The resulting visuals became the cornerstone of the rebrand, showcasing the exceptional space and lifestyle that Peter Cooper Village offers to its residents.</p>
