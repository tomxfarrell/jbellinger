        <p>I was tasked with developing an unbranded campaign for Diabetic Neuropathy Pain, which included a microsite, digital banners, and a social media strategy. The campaign zeroed in on one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of diabetes: foot pain. To visually represent the intensity of this pain, we crafted striking illustrationsâ€”one depicting a floor engulfed in flames and another showing the sensation of walking on spikes. To amplify the impact, we introduced subtle yet powerful animations: glowing embers flickered in the fire illustration, while sharp highlights brought the spikes to life. The result was a visually dynamic and emotionally resonant campaign that connected with audiences and highlighted the real challenges of living with diabetic neuropathy.</p>
